# About
Xiang Qi, also known as Chinese chess is a traditional game originated from China. Xiang Qi is similar in many respect to Chess, but is arguably more complicated. It has a higher branching factor, and each of the pieces has more restrictions as compared to Chess.

This is how the Xiang Qi board looks like. The board has 9 columns and 10 rows, where the pieces are placed at the line intersections. There is a wide blank space in between the two sides which we will call it the river. You will either play as the red pieces or the black.

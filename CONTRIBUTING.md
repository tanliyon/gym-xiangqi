## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

  - There are no spelling mistakes
  - It reads well
  - It is descriptive and to the point

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository
